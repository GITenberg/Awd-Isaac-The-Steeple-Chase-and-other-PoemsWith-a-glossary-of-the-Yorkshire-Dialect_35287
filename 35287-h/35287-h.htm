<h2 class="gap4"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The Author of the following Poems prefixes a &#8220;Preface&#8221; to them, lest he
should seem to be wanting in respect to his readers, did he not comply
with a custom which is universal. In doing so, however, he would eschew
two kinds of Preface, viz: that in which the author arrogates to himself
the merit of having produced a work entirely <i>new</i>, both in subject, and
in manner of expression, and on that score claims the plaudits of his
friends and the public;&#8212;and that in which the author professes to feel
himself inadequate to the task of composing a book, but at the pressing
solicitation of his friends, with great distrust of his abilities for
such a work, he yields to their entreaties, and pleads his inability in
mitigation of the critic&#8217;s wrath. With respect to the former, the writer
of the present volume professes not to offer to his readers any thing
<i>new</i>, either as to matter, or to language; and as to the latter, the
following pieces were most of them composed several years ago, at
distant intervals of time, and were frequently perused by his friends
long before he had thoughts of publishing them:&#8212;the character of his
poetry is therefore pretty well known to those who are likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> to become
purchasers of his book; and it would be but a bungling apology did he
attempt to shelter its defects under the plea of inability for his task.</p>

<p>It will be unnecessary to say much of the subjects sung of in the
following poems. Though they are various, the author hopes they will all
be found to contain a moral, which, if acted upon in common life, would
direct the conduct to a beneficial end. Many of them are founded on
facts which occurred in the writer&#8217;s neighbourhood, and which he has
endeavoured to turn to a useful purpose. Others are of an experimental
cast, and are the breathings of the poet&#8217;s heart when inflamed by Love
Divine! It has been his constant aim to exhibit the workings of grace in
the heart, its effects on the life, and the glorious futurity to which
it conducts its possessor. For this purpose, he has seized on a variety
of incidents known to many of his friends, which have furnished him with
matter on which to graft a spiritual thought. Life in its spring tide,
or when ebbing in death, home with its simple yet hallowed joys, a
religious assembly rapt in devotion and love, a landscape endeared by
the associations of youth or of kindred, a dilapidated church, a
withering flower, a text of scripture&#8212;have supplied him with topics;&#8212;and
he trusts that the doctrines which he has inculcated in connection with
them will always be found to agree with the Word of God.</p>

<p>Of the &#8220;Dialect&#8221; in which some of the pieces are composed, the author
deems it necessary to say a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> few words. It is well known that every
county in England has its peculiarities of expression and pronunciation.
These peculiarities, though often unintelligible to persons brought up
at a distance, are yet the native language of the common inhabitants;
and there is, in their estimation, a point and power in them, which are
not to be found in more polished periods. The author has availed himself
of the dialect of his native county to convey to a particular class of
persons some important truths, which may, perhaps, be more welcomely
received because clad in that garb. There may, indeed, appear to
delicate ears, a rudeness approaching to barbarism, in the dialect which
he has employed; but what is wanting in polish, will, in the estimation
of those for whom he writes, be more than compensated by force and
vigour. Truth is truth&#8212;however humble the habiliments in which it is
dressed: nor does it come with less power to the heart because conveyed
in language with which those for whom it was intended are familiar.
Indeed, there is in that very <i>familiarity</i> something which arrests the
attention and affects the heart. Of the correctness of this view, the
author has many times seen proof, in the interest with which some of the
pieces in the dialect have been listened to, by persons whose education
being limited they could not perhaps have appreciated the beauties of
polished verse, but were at once arrested and delighted when the artless
tale was narrated in their mother tongue. To make this part of the work
as complete as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> possible, great care has been used to render the
orthography correct: published specimens of the Dialect have been
consulted, as well as living authorities, and no pains have been spared
that could contribute to make it complete both to the eye and to the
ear. A difference of orthography may occasionally appear, caused by the
necessity of making a rhyme;&#8212;excepting a few rare instances of this
kind, a standard has been adopted which has not been departed from. For
the assistance of those who are unacquainted with the dialect of the
North Riding of Yorkshire, a copious glossary is appended to the work,
by reference to which the meaning of any unknown term or phrase will at
once be seen.</p>

<p>The author prays that the blessing of God may accompany his work!</p>

<span class="i0">To say what thou art now, and once hast been?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once the dear seat of all my earthly joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now, in recollection only, rise!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Methinks, where&#8217;er I look no life appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the place a cheerless aspect wears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy groves are desolate, thy swains are fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many of them number&#8217;d with the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religion &#8217;s cold, the poor are sore oppress&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy orphans weep, and widows are distress&#8217;d.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where leaping fishes on the surface play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gladly seems to close, the summer&#8217;s day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broken waters from yon glen resound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their constant rippling &#8217;s heard the village round;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While tears of oil hang on his rusty cheeks;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pedestrians joyful, here and there were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While shays and whiskeys deck&#8217;d her level green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The banks of Esk, were crowded all along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either with Anglers, or with lookers on.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The full &#8220;Moon,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> then did through her valleys shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bright, some thought she never would decline;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Year after year she in her sphere did move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all seem&#8217;d animation, life, and love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, in mists and gloom she disappears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eclips&#8217;d&#8212;her light no longer Lealholm cheers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pluck&#8217;d from her orb, her borrow&#8217;d lustre&#8217;s fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the silent tomb, she rests her head.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In distant lands my father&#8217;s lot was cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we were left to feel the bitter blast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death&#8217;s fatal hand its victim did arrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tore him from the darlings of his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, by a mother&#8217;s care, when young was led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down by the river to yon primrose bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where birds so sweetly sung the trees among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought those days were happy, bright, and long.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Oft I, a boy, with others of my age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did eager here in youthful sports engage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft in yon wood we rov&#8217;d when life was new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rocks, and trees and rugged caves to view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where woodbines wild, with sweets perfum&#8217;d the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all seem&#8217;d joyous, beautiful, and fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alas! where&#8217;s now the grove? The trees are gone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many the wide ocean are upon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few remaining springers yet survive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep their owner&#8217;s name and place alive!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just so it is with us, could we but see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our fathers who are in eternity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their offspring live, but they&#8217;re for ever gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their portion&#8217;s fixed, no more will they return!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May we be wise, and lessons learn afresh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trust no longer in an arm of flesh!&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begin to seek, and rest not till we find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peace of God, which satisfies the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then seeing all my earthly joys are fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, O my soul! art thou for succour led?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis Jesus, that can all thy wants supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fountain &#8217;s there which never will run dry:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arabia&#8217;s grove, nor Sharon&#8217;s flowery field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such rich perfume, such holy incense yield:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis Jesus&#8217; merit, and his dying love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis these perfume the glorious courts above!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Attend, all ye who Zion&#8217;s tidings love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hearts and hopes are fix&#8217;d on things above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose chief delight is centred in the fame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All ye who virtue love, and evil hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attend, while I a simple tale relate.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A preacher being to a village sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To warn and woo the people to repent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depending only on God&#8217;s mighty grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pious soul was looking for success.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For God, his people had a house prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which his arm had many times been bared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in that little village congregation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were found some earnest seekers of salvation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the rest a noted Bruiser stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hands had oft been stain&#8217;d with human blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man of constitution so robust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He oft had laid Goliaths in the dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fully on the preacher fix&#8217;d his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scarcely could declare the reason why;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The subject, and the theme on which he dwelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught his attention, and its force he felt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought the preacher all his actions knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His words, like arrows, pierc&#8217;d his conscience through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spirits fell, his heart was sick and sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such anguish he had never felt before.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<span class="i0">It seem&#8217;d to him as if an angel spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt within as if his heart was broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought he heard mount Sinai&#8217;s thunder roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shook the very centre of his soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such mighty strokes soon humbled all his pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sank condemn&#8217;d, and loud for mercy cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; said he, &#8220;Nay, who can tell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how shall I escape the pit of Hell?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On bended knees he did salvation seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big tears roll&#8217;d down his long undaunted cheek:&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people pray&#8217;d, the sinner wept the more,&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This man, who till that hour, ne&#8217;er wept before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a time his mighty anguish ceas&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord of life his captive soul releas&#8217;d!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joy he felt he scarcely could contain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people sung&#8212;&#8220;a sinner&#8217;s born again!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some time elaps&#8217;d&#8212;two of his mates had met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As custom was, and in a tavern sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conversing on events that daily pass&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one the other thus address&#8217;d at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Heard you not what occurred the other day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Sam has been converted, people say!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Old Sam!&#8221; the other says, with great surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;What Sam, the Boxer?&#8221; &#8220;Yes!&#8221; the other cries!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Depend upon&#8217;t, though you may think it strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in old Sam there is a wondrous change!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nay,&#8212;he converted! Pshaw! &#8217;tis all a whim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They&#8217;ve just as much converted me as him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I can find a man, I have no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That soon will beat all his religion out.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Perhaps not so,&#8221; the other softly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;I think Old Sam &#8217;s of better mettle made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know that he was always bad to bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his firmness I will still depend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other rose, and would a wager bet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Sam was not so far converted yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that if pick&#8217;d at, he would turn again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still he would the bloody cause maintain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Sammy&#8217;s door their way direct they took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he had now the tavern&#8217;s haunts forsook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call&#8217;d a rebel out to lead the van,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vex and aggravate the poor old man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length they reach&#8217;d, and rattled at the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing around, like lions to devour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His happy soul; but he had by his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King David&#8217;s faithful Shepherd for his guide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Sammy from his Bible reading rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straightway forth to meet the rebel goes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Here&#8217;s one,&#8221; say they, &#8220;will fight for what you like!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stamp&#8217;d, and raged, and dared old Sam to strike;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sam look&#8217;d and smiled, as he before him stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shook his head, thinking the cause not good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length his flaming passion to control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cries, &#8220;The Lord have mercy on thy soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy case I pity, O thou man of might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although this practice once was my delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm thy fierce rage, and to old Sam attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before destruction prove thy awful end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I clearly see the spirit thou art in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I myself oft in the same have been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a one like thee I&#8217;ve made to bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought their boasting valour to an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis well for thee that I&#8217;m another man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thou wouldst rue the day that this began;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I soon should settle all thy boasts and brags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make thy bones fall rattling on the flags!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mayst thank God, whose power and grace divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have chang&#8217;d this proud, rebellious heart of mine;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The love I feel to thee forbids the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which soon would lay thy boasting prowess low.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restrain thy passion, give old Sam thine hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thankful that thou dost before him stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go tell the men whom once I did adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wager&#8217;s lost, old Sam will fight no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell them to save their money for their wives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give up their folly, and reform their lives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go and seek salvation while they may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the wrath of God drives them away!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sam&#8217;s noble speech so satisfied them all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That not one there durst him a coward call.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Although the wager &#8217;s fairly lost,&#8221; say they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;We all must own old Sam hath won the day!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Sammy like a warrior stout and bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeks new companions, and forsakes the old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While shouts of praise his ravish&#8217;d ears surround,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hears, and understands, the joyful sound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, Sammy has a better master now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more substantial friends to deal with too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure he leans on his Redeemer&#8217;s breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweetly sings himself away to rest.<br /></span></div></div>

<p class="smaller center">Occasioned by seeing two &#8220;<i>Sinkers</i>&#8221; dragged out of a Coal Pit;
one of them killed, the other dreadfully wounded. At a short
distance, a busy crowd were preparing their tents and posts for
the approaching races, on Easter Monday and Tuesday. On
mentioning the fatal occurrence, and naming the day, a
bystander exclaimed, &#8220;O, Good Friday is nought!&#8221;</p>


<div class="poem gap2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The morning sun shone dim, as if in pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see that day by man so soon despised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feather&#8217;d choirs did heedless man reprove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had more cause than they, with early song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet the morn, on which their Saviour bled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! that man should e&#8217;er forget his love!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down, down the pit, the cheerful sinkers went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor grief, nor fear through all the gloom appear&#8217;d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though at the bottom deep, grim death sat shrouded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In horrid features, measuring their minutes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foul was the air, and bad;&#8212;they saw him not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor dream&#8217;d he was so near, nor held dispute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which the lot might fall, to be his victim:&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly, through wanton carelessness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the just judgment of an angry God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kibble kick&#8217;d, brim full of splinter&#8217;d rock!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down fell at once his ponderous instrument,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full thirty fathom, whizzing as it went!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath its heavy crash a victim fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And groan&#8217;d, nor ceas&#8217;d, till he had groan&#8217;d his last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from behind the scene the monster stept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his bony fingers hurl&#8217;d his dart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its point another touch&#8217;d, but not so deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the pit I saw the sufferers dragg&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard deep groans, and saw their mangled flesh.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The former then with grief was quick interr&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other a poor halting cripple lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where&#8217;s now the man that says &#8220;Good Friday&#8217;s nought?&#8221;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I could, if &#8217;twere requested, fill these sheets;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the man who thinks, and judges right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This may suffice. And is Good Friday nought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is that day nought on which our Saviour bled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To buy our pardon, to save by suff&#8217;ring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open salvation&#8217;s fount for crimson crimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wash, and make us guilty lepers clean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas for man! He sees, he feels it not!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of old, men saw, and felt it, though far off.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The martyrs saw, own&#8217;d, and observ&#8217;d it too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fasting, prayer, and self-denial;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This made them march, when call&#8217;d, with holy joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet the dagger&#8217;s point, or burning stake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth once felt, and felt to her foundations;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marble mountain felt, and quak&#8217;d, and shiver&#8217;d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun felt, and grew dark; the heavens wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hell beneath, in dismal groanings howl&#8217;d!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The serpent felt,&#8212;and still feels in his bruis&#8217;d head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saviour!&#8212;Yes, the King of Glory felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that sad cup his subjects should have drunk:&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both in the temple, and the wilderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The street, the judgment hall,&#8212;in Pilate&#8217;s scourge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cruel mockings, and the scarlet robe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt it too beneath the rugged wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When He fatigued climb&#8217;d Calvary&#8217;s steep brow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt it in the hammer and the nails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pierc&#8217;d his flesh, though he offended not!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt it in the reed, and crown of thorns!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In strange upbraidings, and the soldier&#8217;s spear!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He felt it in that mighty crush, which should,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would have crush&#8217;d, his guilty murderers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt it till his mortal part expir&#8217;d!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He feels it yet, and so do his disciples:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the proud stiff-neck&#8217;d sinner feels it not;&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perverse, he <i>will not</i>, yet one day he shall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he at present, feast and garnish out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife&#8217;s, or children&#8217;s birth days, and his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With songs, and cards, and music, and the dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet this, like Job&#8217;s day, shall be blotted out!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he <i>will not</i>, yet he shall regard it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When God appears in majesty, and power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arm&#8217;d with thunder-bolts, and chariots of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all his foes to pour his vengeance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes! All men then will wish to be his friends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E&#8217;en those who have his words and grace despis&#8217;d,<br /></span>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
